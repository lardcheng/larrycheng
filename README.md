Hi there!

I'm Larry Cheng. I am a data analyst with experience using SQL and Power BI & Tableau. I have a background in Finance, and I love working with numbers. 

About Me

- Finance education with a Bachelor's in Business
- Transitioned to data analysis in 2022 when I was hired to my first corporate position
- I enjoy combining data with creativity and coming up with fun and appealing (at least to myself) dashboards and trackers

Feel free to check out my Notion page below for dashboards related to some of my projects here!
