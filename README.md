Hi there!

I'm Larry Cheng. I am a data analyst with experience using SQL and Power BI & Tableau. I have a background in Finance, and I love working with numbers. 

About Me

- Finance education with a Bachelor's in Business
- Transitioned to data analysis in 2022 when I was hired to my first corporate position
- I enjoy combining data with creativity and coming up with fun and appealing (at least to myself) dashboards and trackers
